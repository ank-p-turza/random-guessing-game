In this game user will input an integer which is the minimum value then the game will ask range. Here this program will generate number the minimum value (at first you have entered) and minimum value + ranger. You have to guess a number between these two and enter it into the textbox. If the number, you have entered and the number the game generated is same you will get 1 score. If both are not same, you will lose one option of giving wrong answer. You will get 5 options of giving wrong answer. After that the game will be over. The further instructions are in Readme.pdf.
